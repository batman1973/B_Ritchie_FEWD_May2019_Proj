# Bruce's Subaru Forum :blue_car: :red_car:

This is a website that I put together to display my collection of Subaru Wrx's that I have collected so far.  This site is only a one page with inactive links.  I have put a buttton to hide my car display as an option to the viewer/user.

## Installation

There should be no installation needed to run this website.  Just launch the index.html file and enjoy!!!!

## Note :point_down:
One of the mentors suggested that I put this into my HTML code.  Google Chrome was not responding as it should have--According to him--and this seemed to fix this issue.  However, it was responsive to manually dragging the right side of the browser's window displaying the responsive design.

```bash
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
```
